AirBnB clone
An emulation of the web application AirBnB. The project had six steps, with each step linking to a concept.

We were required to do the following:

The console
create your data model
manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”.

Web static
learn HTML/CSS
create the HTML of your application
create template of each object
MySQL storage
replace the file storage by a Database storage
map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.
Web framework - templating
create your first web server in Python
make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database
RESTful API
expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
manipulate your objects via a RESTful API
Web dynamic
learn JQuery
load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API
